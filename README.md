## About
I believe that learning from practice is the most effective. To keep honing my mobile skills, I challenged myself to build an application with a custom UI without using external libraries.

I have created all charts, animations, and custom widgets myself, using components provided by Flutter or even layers of canvas. The application uses randomly generated data, but its architecture allows you to easily connect to an external provider (e.g. REST API) without changing views or cubits.

I approached Vizier like we would any other commercial project. Now that itâ€™s public, you can see for yourself the quality of work I deliver.
